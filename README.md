# Snake Project by Rifatul Istiaque, Jessica Malark, Abe Gebeyehu
MIPS Assembly Language, Using MARS IDE

Directions:
  The snake moves with keys w, s, a, d corresponding to north, south, east, and west respectively.
  The objective of the game is to make the snake grow as large as possible without hitting any obstacles.
  The game is over when an obstacle is hit such as a wall or the snake itself.
  
  
To implement snake in MARS you’ll need to use the “Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator” for input and the Bitmap
Display for output (the screen). Your Bitmap display should have 8x8 units (unit width and unit height are both 8 pixels)
and the display should be 256 x 256 pixels in total. The base address should be $gp.
